### Creating a Telegram Bot and Obtaining a Token

1. Chat with [BotFather](https://t.me/botfather) on Telegram.
2. Follow prompts to name your bot and get a token.
3. Store the token as a GitHub secret (`TELEGRAM_TOKEN`).

### Obtaining the Chat ID
Run the following command:
```bash
curl https://api.telegram.org/bot<token>/getUpdates
```
Replace <token> with your bot's token to find your `chat_id` (`TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID`).

### Local Development

You can build this action from source using `Go`:

```bash
make build
```
